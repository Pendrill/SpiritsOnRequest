There is a video game club in the school . I decided to go to one of their events , but from the looks of it, they seem to only be interested in e-sports. I would have to spend $60 just to be able to play this one game with them. Who knows whether they will still be playing that game in a week ? I talked to them about Lucky’s Tail and then showed them a gameplay video , but none of them seemed interested . I guess I’ll just have to wait and see if any of my friends go online.
