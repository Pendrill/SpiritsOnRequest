All the students I have talked to here seem so mean and self-centered. They just cannot stop talking about how much of an intellectual they all are. Why would I want to spend time with those types of people? At this point I would much rather just stay in my room . Actually, I would much rather go home . I remember when I left, dad told me that whenever I felt like it, I could come home . Maybe I should.
