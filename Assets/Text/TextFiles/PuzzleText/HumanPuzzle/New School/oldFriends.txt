I think I should have gone to a state school just like my friends . We would have been able to hang out and play Lucky’s Tail. But now with the time difference, it is almost impossible to get a hold of them at a reasonable time . We do play the game sometimes, but I do not want to rely on them too much. What if they realize that I have not been able to make any new friends , or that I am having a tough time adapting to city life?
