Why did I decide to attend this school so far away from home . I do not know what has gotten into me, but I miss my family so much. I mean , I have been away from them before, but this time it feels different. It hurts . There are times when I open the door to my dorm and realize that there is no one there waiting for me, I just want to lock myself in the bathroom and cry until those feelings of loneliness are gone .
